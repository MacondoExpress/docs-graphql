== Type definitions

Quries on this page assume the following type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Post @node {
    id: ID! @id
    content: String!
    creator: User! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: IN, properties: "PostedAt")
    createdAt: DateTime!
}

type User @node {
    id: ID! @id
    name: String!
    age: Int!
    posts: [Post!]! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: OUT, properties: "PostedAt")
    friends: [User!]! @relationship(type: "FRIENDS_WITH", direction: OUT)
}

type PostedAt @relationshipProperties {
    date: DateTime
}
----

For which the following query fields are generated:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Query {
    posts(where: PostWhere, options: PostOptions): [Post!]!
    postsAggregate(where: PostWhere): PostAggregationSelection!

    users(where: UserWhere, options: UserOptions): [User!]!
    usersAggregate(where: UserWhere): UserAggregationSelection!
}
----

== Writing queries

Based on the type definitions, here are two examples of how to write queries for reading or retrieving values:

.Return all User nodes from their ID and name
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        id
        name
    }
}
----

.Query User with name "Jane Smith" and their posts
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users(where: { name: "Jane Smith" }) {
        id
        name
        posts {
            content
        }
    }
}
----

== Undirected queries

All xref::/types/relationships.adoc[relationships] are created with a direction from one node to another.
By default, all queries follow the direction defined in the relationship. 
However, in some cases it is necessary to query for all related nodes, regardless of the direction of the relationship. 
This can be achieved with the argument `directed: false`.

For example, the following query should return all User friends, regardless of the direction of the relationship `"FRIENDS_WITH"`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users {
        name
        friends: friends(directed: false) {
            name
        }
    }
}
----

In addition, undirected relationships can also be used in the same fashion with connections.
For instance, this query is asking for a list of users and their friends' names with an undirected friendship connection:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query Query {
  users {
    friendsConnection(directed: false) {
      edges {
        node {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Keep in mind that *undirected relationships are only supported in queries*.
The xref::/types/relationships.adoc#_querydirection[type definitions] for a relationship may define a different behavior, so the `directed` option may not be available in some cases.
