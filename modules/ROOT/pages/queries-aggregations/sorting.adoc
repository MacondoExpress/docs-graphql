:description: This page describes how to use sorting input types.

A sorting input type is generated for every object type defined in your type definitions.
It allows for query results to be sorted by each individual field.

Using this example type definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie @node {
  title: String!
  runtime: Int!
}
----

The following sorting input type and query should be generated:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
  title: String!
  runtime: Int!
}

enum SortDirection {
  ASC
  DESC
}

input MovieConnectionSort {
  node: MovieSort
}

input MovieSort {
  title: SortDirection
  runtime: SortDirection
}

input MovieOptions {
  """Specify one or more MovieSort objects to sort Movies by. The sorts will be applied in the order in which they are arranged in the array."""
  sort: [MovieSort!]
  limit: Int
  offset: Int
}

type Query {
  movies(where: MovieOperationWhere): MovieOperation
}

type MovieOperation {
  connection(after: String, first: Int, sort: [MovieConnectionSort!]): MovieConnection
}
----

The resulting query should then allow fetching all movies sorted by runtime in ascending order:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
  movies {
    connection(sort: { node: { title: DESC } }) {
      edges {
        node {
          title
          runtime
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Additionally, in case there was a relationship between the `Movie` and an `Actor` type, sorting can also be applied when fetching the `actors` field:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
  movies {
      connection {
        edges {
          node {
              title
              actors {
                connection(sort: { edges: { node: { surname: ASC } } }) {
                  edges {
                    node {
                      surname
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
          }
        }
      }
  }
}
----
