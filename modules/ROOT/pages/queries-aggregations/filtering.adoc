:description: This page describes filtering operators.

When querying for data, a number of operators are available for different types in the `where` argument of a query or mutation.

== Equality operators

All types can be tested for either equality.
For non-equality, you *must* use the xref:/queries-aggregations/filtering.adoc#_combining_operators[`NOT`] logical operator.
For example:

.Filtering all users named John
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
  users(where: {name: "John" })
    id
    name
  }
----

[NOTE]
====
For the `Boolean` type, equality operators are the only ones available.
====

== Numerical operators

These are the operators available for numeric (`Int`, `Float`, xref::/types/scalar.adoc[`BigInt`]), xref::/types/temporal.adoc[temporal] and xref::/types/spatial.adoc[spatial] types:

* `_LT`
* `_LTE`
* `_GT`
* `_GTE`

Here is an example of how to use them:

.Filtering users younger than 50 years old
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
  users(where: {age_LT: 50 }) {
    id
    name
    age
  }
}
----

Spatial types use numerical filtering differently and they also have additional options. 
See xref:filtering.adoc#_spatial_types[Spatial types] for more information.

== Logical operators

All operators can be combined using the logical operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.
They can also be standalone operators, which means that they can be used as such and not be appended to field names.

These operators accept an array argument with items of the same format as the `where` argument, which means they can also be nested to form complex combinations.

For example, if you want to match all actors by the name of either "Keanu" or not belonging to the "Pantoliano" family, that played in "The Matrix" movie, here is how you can query that:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    actors(where: { 
        AND: [
            { 
                OR: [
                    { name_CONTAINS: "Keanu" },
                    { NOT: { name_ENDS_WITH: "Pantoliano" } }
                ]
            },
            {
                movies_SOME: { title: "The Matrix" }
            }
        ]}
    ) {
        name
        movies {
            title
        }
    }
}
----


== String comparison

The following case-sensitive comparison operators are only available for use on `String` and `ID` types:

* `_STARTS_WITH`
* `_ENDS_WITH`
* `_CONTAINS`

Here is an example of how to use them:

.Filtering users with name starting with "J"
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
  users(where: { name_STARTS_WITH: "J" }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
----

Additionally, numerical operators can be used for String comparisons.
They are disabled default.
To enable them, add them in the `filters` features options for `String`:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const { Neo4jGraphQL } = require("@neo4j/graphql");
const neo4j = require("neo4j-driver");

const typeDefs = `
    type User @node {
        name: String
    }
`;

const driver = neo4j.driver(
    "bolt://localhost:7687",
    neo4j.auth.basic("username", "password")
);

const features = {
    filters: {
        String: {
            LT: true,
            GT: true,
            LTE: true,
            GTE: true
        }
    }
};

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ features, typeDefs, driver });
----

== RegEx matching

The filter `_MATCHES` is also available for comparison of `String` and `ID` types.
It accepts RegEx strings as an argument and returns any matches.


Note that RegEx matching filters are **disabled by default**.
This is because, on an unprotected API, they could potentially be used to execute a https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS[ReDoS attack^] against the backing Neo4j database.

If you want to enable them, set the features configuration object for each:

[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const features = {
    filters: {
        String: {
            MATCHES: true,
        }
    }
};

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ features, typeDefs, driver });
----

For `ID`:


[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const features = {
    filters: {
        String: {
            ID: true,
        }
    }
};

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ features, typeDefs, driver });
----

For both `String` and `ID`:


[source, javascript, indent=0]
----
const features = {
    filters: {
        String: {
            MATCHES: true,
        },
        ID: {
            MATCHES: true,
        }
    }
};

const neoSchema = new Neo4jGraphQL({ features, typeDefs, driver });
----

== Array comparison

The following operator is available on non-array fields, and accepts an array argument:

* `_IN`

Conversely, the following operator is available on array fields, and accepts a single argument:

* `_INCLUDES`

These operators are available for all types apart from `Boolean`.

== Filtering spatial types

Both the `Point` and the `CartesianPoint` types use xref::queries-aggregations/filtering.adoc#_numerical_operators[numerical operators] and have an additional `_DISTANCE` filter.
Here is a list of what each filter does for the two types:

* `_LT`: checks if a point is less than the distance in the `distance` field away (in meters) from the point specified by the `point` field.
* `_LTE`: checks if a point is less than or equal to the distance in the `distance` field away (in meters) from the point specified by the `point` field.
* `_DISTANCE`: checks if a point is the exact distance in the `distance` field away (in meters) from the point specified by the `point` field.
* `_GT`: checks if a point is greater than the distance in the `distance` field away (in meters) from the point specified by the `point` field.
* `_GTE`: checks if a point is greater than or equal to the distance in the `distance` field away (in meters) from the point specified by the `point` field.

For a `Point` type, all filters take the following type as an argument:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
input PointDistance {
    point: Point!
    distance: Float!
}
----

In practice, you can construct queries like the following, which finds all users within a 5km (5000m) radius of a `Point`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query CloseByUsers($longitude: Float!, $latitude: Float!) {
    users(where: { location_LTE: { point: { longitude: $longitude, latitude: $latitude }, distance: 5000 } }) {
        name
        location {
            longitude
            latitude
        }
    }
}
----

Similarly, for a `CartesianPoint` type, all filters take the following type as an argument:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
input CartesianPointDistance {
    point: CartesianPoint!
    distance: Float!
}
----

The same query for a `CartesianPoint`:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query CloseByUsers($x: Float!, $y: Float!) {
  users(where: { location_LTE: { point: { x: $x, y: $y }, distance: 5000 } }) {
    name
    location {
      x
      y
    }
  }
}
----

== Querying an interface

You can use the `typename_IN` filter to filter interfaces.
Refer to xref:types/interfaces.adoc#type-definitions-interfaced-types-querying[Type definitions -> Type -> Interface] for more details and an example.

== Relationship filtering

Relationship filtering depends on the type of relationship that you have:

* `n..1`: filtering done on equality or inequality of the related nodes by specifying a filter on `field`.
* `n..m`: filtering is done on the list of related nodes and is based on the https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/predicate/[list predicates] available in Cypher:
** `field_ALL` - https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/predicate/#functions-all[all]
** `field_NONE` - https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/predicate/#functions-none[none]
** `field_SOME` - https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/predicate/#functions-any[any]
** `field_SINGLE` - https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/predicate/#functions-single[single]

As an example, take these type definitions:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User @node {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    posts: [Post!]! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: OUT)
}

type Post @node {
    id: ID!
    content: String
    author: User! @relationship(type: "HAS_POST", direction: IN)
    likes: [User!]! @relationship(type: "LIKES", direction: IN)
}
----
=== `n..1` relationships

An `author` represents an `n..1` relationship on `Post`, where a given `Post` is authored by one, and only one, `author`. 
The available filters here will be `author`.
For example:

.Find all posts by a desired author
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    posts(where: { author: { id: "7CF1D9D6-E527-4ACD-9C2A-207AE0F5CB8C" } }) {
        content
    }
}
----

.Find all posts `NOT` by an undesired author
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    posts(where: { NOT: { author: { id: "7CF1D9D6-E527-4ACD-9C2A-207AE0F5CB8C" } } }) {
        content
    }
}
----

=== `n..m` relationships

In the previous example, `posts` represents a `n..m` relationship on `User`, where a given `User` can have any number of `posts`.
Here are some query examples:

.Find all users where all of their posts contain search term: `"neo4j"`
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users(where: { posts_ALL: { content_CONTAINS: "neo4j" } }) {
        name
    }
}
----

.Find all users where none of their posts contains search term: `"cypher"`
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users(where: { posts_NONE: { content_CONTAINS: "cypher" } }) {
        name
    }
}
----

.Find all users where some of their posts contain search term: `"graphql"`
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users(where: { posts_SOME: { content_CONTAINS: "graphql" } }) {
        name
    }
}
----

.Find all users where only one of their posts contain search term: `"graph"`
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    users(where: { posts_SINGLE: { content_CONTAINS: "graph" } }) {
        name
    }
}
----

== Aggregation filtering

This library offers, for each relationship, an aggregation key inside the `where` argument. 
It can be used both on the `node` and `edge` of a relationship.

Here are some examples on how to apply this kind of filtering:

. *Find posts where the number of likes are greater than 5*
+
.Schema example
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User @node {
    name: String
}

type Post @node {
    content: String
    likes: [User!]! @relationship(type: "LIKES", direction: IN)
}
----
+ 
.Query
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    posts(where: { likesAggregate: { count_GT: 5 } }) {
        content
    }
}
----

. *Find flights where the average age of passengers is greater than or equal to 18*
+
.Schema example
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Passenger @node {
    name: String
    age: Int
}

type Flight @node {
    code: String
    passengers: [Passenger!]! @relationship(type: "FLYING_ON", direction: IN)
}
----
+
.Query
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    flights(where: { passengersAggregate: { node: { age_AVERAGE_GTE: 18 } } }) {
        code
    }
}
----

. *Find movies where the shortest actor screen time is less than 10 minutes*
+
.Schema example
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie @node {
    title: String
    actors: [Person!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN, properties: "ActedIn")
}

type Person @node {
    name: String
}

type ActedIn @relationshipProperties {
    screenTime: Int
}
----
+
.Query
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    movies(where: { actorsAggregate: { edge: { screenTime_MIN_LT: 10 } } }) {
        title
    }
}
----

=== Operators

Aggregation filtering can also be done with operators.
They provide autogenerated filters available for each type on the `node` and `edge` of the specified relationship.
