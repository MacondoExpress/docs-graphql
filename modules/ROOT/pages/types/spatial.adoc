:description: This page lists the spatial types available in the Neo4j GraphQL Library.

== Spatial Types

Neo4j GraphQL spatial types translate to spatial values stored using https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/values-and-types/spatial/[`Point`] in the database. 
The use of either of these types in a GraphQL schema automatically introduces the types needed to run queries and mutations relevant to these spatial types.

[[point]]
=== `Point`

The `Point` type is used to describe the two https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/values-and-types/spatial/#spatial-values-crs-geographic[Geographic coordinate reference systems] supported by Neo4j.

In order to use it in your schema, you quite simply add a field with a type `Point` to any type or types in schema, like the following:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type TypeWithPoint @node {
    location: Point!
}
----

Once this has been done, the `Point` type is automatically added to your schema, in addition to all of the input and output types you need to query and manipulate spatial types through your API.

These are the automatically generated types and how to use them:

==== Type definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Point {
    latitude: Float!
    longitude: Float!
    height: Float
}
----

==== Queries

You can query for users and their locations:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query Users {
  users {
    connection {
      edges {
        node {
          name
          location {
            longitude
            latitude
            height
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----


[[cartesian-point]]
=== `CartesianPoint`

The `CartesianPoint` type is used to describe the two https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/values-and-types/spatial/#spatial-values-crs-cartesian[Cartesian coordinate reference systems] supported by Neo4j.

To use it in the schema, add a field with a type `CartesianPoint` to any type or types, such as in this example:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type TypeWithCartesianPoint @node {
    location: CartesianPoint!
}
----

Once this has been done, the `CartesianPoint` type is automatically added to your schema, in addition to all of the input and output types you will need to query and manipulate spatial types through your API.

These are the automatically generated types and how to use them:

==== Type definition

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type CartesianPoint {
    x: Float!
    y: Float!
    z: Float
}
----

==== Queries

You can query for users and their locations:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query Users {
  users {
    connection {
      edges {
        node {
          name
          location {
            x
            y
            z
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
